# =============================
# Slider Settings

# READ ME: This is where you can add more slides or change slider content!
#          Please remember to do not add lengthy content inside the slider or it will
#          ruin the format.

# How to add slides: Simply copy paste existing line into new one, for example:

# slides:
# - {title: "Title",
#   subtitle: "subtitle",
#   background: "slide-2.jpg"}
#
# // To add new slide just copy paste into a new line.
#
# - {title: "Slide 3",
#   subtitle: "Slide 3 subtitle"
#   background: "slide-2.jpg"}

# IMPORTANT: The slider is currently set to a maximum number of "5" slides (including the first slide)! If you wish
#            to remove the limit, please contact the developer.
#
# IMPORTANT: For advanced layouts, you need to atleast know basic HTML & CSS.
#            please contact the developer.

# IMPORTANT: Backgrounds must be inside the 'assets/img' folder! If not, you will not see the background.
#            It is also advisable to have the background in 1080 x 720 size so that it will not take too much
#            time to load! Also, remember to include the file-type! (.jpg or .png)
#
# You may change the first slide's content in the 'settings.yml' file.
