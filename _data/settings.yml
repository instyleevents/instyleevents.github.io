# Tagline

# READ ME: Before you change the tagline in the welcome page, some notes to remember:
#          <br> - breaks a line into two lines.
#          e.g  - Makes every moment Memorable... (when added <br> it turns into)
#                         -
#                 Makes every moment
#                     Memorable...
#          <span> - changes the text color to #FF0030 or Red.
#
# Remember: Avoid having too long taglines! It's best to keep it under 8 words to not break the layout.
